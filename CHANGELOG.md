## [1.0.0]

### Breaking

- Moved from material ui styling to css files. In order to use the default styles, you will need to import the css file from `'react-loqate/dist/react-loqate.cjs.development.css'`.
- Moved the individual className props to a shared `classes` prop

### Other

- Moved from @material-ui to @mui/base for utilities
